          <div class="note">Situated in Sri Lanka’s south-east hugging the panoramic Indian Ocean, Yala was designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1900 and was designated a national park in 1938. Ironically, the park was initially used as a hunting ground for the elite under British rule. Yala is home to 44 varieties of mammal and 215 bird species. Among its more famous residents are the world’s biggest concentration of leopards, majestic elephants, sloth bears, sambars, jackals, spotted dear, peacocks, and crocodiles. The best time to visit Yala is between February and July when the water levels of the park are quite low, bringing animals into the open.</div>

          <div class="note">Located on the North-Western coast of the country. Wilpattu is the largenst national Park in the island. It covers an area of 131,693 hectares of dry lowland forest with a unique cluster of water bodies referred to as "Villus" which are naturally formed rain fed lakes. It is said that these villus are also fed by ground water sources and the creation of the villu is due to such ground water reaching the surface of the earth due to pressure created underground. The area was declared a sanctuary in 1905 and was upgraded as a national park of the 25th of February 1938.Wilpattu North sanctuary declared on 7th November 1947, lies inland from the coast, is contiguous with the park and is located entirely within Northern Province.</div>

This leopard has a tawny to rusty yellow-colored coat with rosettes that are smaller than that of the Indian leopards. Since the Sri Lankan leopard faces no competition in its habitat and is the apex predator therein, it grows quite large. Males of this subspecies often weight as much as 100 kg. These felids occupy a wide variety of habitats ranging from grasslands and forest patches to tea estates and plantations. They are solitary hunters and usually nocturnal. They prey on small mammals, reptiles, and birds. The Sri Lankan leopard is threatened with habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and persecution. IUCN has enlisted the species as enremoveed.</p></td>

Human-animal conflicts and habitat destruction threaten the survival of the Sri Lankan elephant. 50% of the population of these animals have been lost over the last three generations.

The purple-faced langurs have a largely folivorous diet consisting of fruits, seeds, and flowers. Sadly, these animals are subjected to numerous challenges in their habitat. Their range is continuously decreasing due to deforestation and urbanization. Much of the natural forests where they thrived have now been destroyed. The langurs have no been forced to live closer to humans and are often subjected to persecution due to human-animal conflict.</p></td>

Only about 500 individuals of this species remain in the wild in small, isolated populations.
